# Image Captioning with Transformer
This repository includes code for the master's thesis project named "Generating Natural Language Descriptions of Image Content using Neural Networks". Implemented model is build using Tensorflow on the MS-COCO dataset. The implementation closely follows the code from [Tensorflow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/transformer). 

The end-to-end implementation is in ```image_captioning_full.ipynb```. The code can be run in Google Colab.
