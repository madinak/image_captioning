# Image Captioning with Transformer
This repository contains a modular implementation of an image captioning model using TensorFlow and the MS-COCO dataset. The project is divided into several modules for better organization and maintainability. The implementation closely follows the code from [Tensorflow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/transformer). 

The end-to-end implementation is in ```image_captioning_full.ipynb```. The notebook can be run in Google Colab.
